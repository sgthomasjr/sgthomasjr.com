        <h2>Software Quality Assurance</h2>
        <p>So your many years of IT experiences has cumulated into the area of QA. What are the next steps?</p>
        <h3>Your new role</h3>
        <p>Whether a manual tester or an engineer, QA will be a key member of the environment to ensure that products meet or exceed organization/industry quality standards and end-user requirements. QA will create test plans and/or write automated tests
            for assigned components of the software product, execute those test plans, and perform bug tracking and management in a rapid, agile development environment utilizing Scum principles. They will collaborate closely with the design team to foster
            excellent usability and to replicate customer environments while helping to create and implement quality processes and requirements.</p>

        <h3>Things you will do in your new role</h3>
        <p>Generate detailed, comprehensive and well-structured test plans. Devise innovative ways to define and continually improve QA and testing processes. Perform QA testing to ensure tasks are completed as documented; verify that changes are bug free.
            Demonstrate visible progress on work and cross functional behavior to ensure quality, on-time delivery. Engage with Software Engineers and Product Owners to communicate risks and issues and clear impediments that have the potential to impact
            the delivery schedule. Create, contribute to and maintain product documentation, ensuring high level of specification completeness, quality and consistency. Actively engage in the review of documentation and critically assess the existing
            standards and documentation set, fostering continuous improvement. Incorporate approved improvements into the specification and documentation set on an on-going basis and update standards.</p>

        <h3>Gain experience with automated testing frameworks</h3>
        <p>To choose a JavaScript test automation framework, consider several variablesHow many types of apps and configurations do you need to support? Frameworks like WebdriverIO are the most extensible. Do you need to test mobile as well as desktop apps?
            If so, frameworks that broadly support both types of apps, like WebdriverIO, are a good choice. How robust and mature do you want the framework to be? Frameworks like Puppeteer, TestCafe, and WebdriverIO are tried-and-true. Do you need a framework
            that can handle front-end as well as back-end testing, like Cypress? How quick and easy do you want it to be to write, configure, and run tests? Currently, frameworks like Puppeteer and Playwright require some relatively complex configuration,
            especially if you are not using them for the narrow use cases that they support out-of-the-box.</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <p><a class="URL" href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a></p>
            <p class="small_indent">Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you.Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks
                can (and should) also be automated as well.</p>
            <p><a class="URL" href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a></p>
            <p class="small_indent">Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster.</p>
            <p><a class="URL" href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a></p>
            <p class="small_indent">Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework software development process for an agile testing methodology, which seems similar to Jira and Confluence.</p>

            <p><a class="URL" href="https://webdriver.io/">Webdriverio</a></p>
            <p class="small_indent">Not to be confused with Selenium WebDriver, which supports only browser testing. Next-gen browser and mobile automation test framework for Node.js. WebdriverIO is a progressive automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications.
                It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and stable test suite. WebdriverIO is a test automation framework for both browser and native mobile testing. It’s highly
                extensible and can automate tests for a wide variety of apps running in any mainstream browser or mobile OS. WebdriverIO’s ability to support a broad set of testing needs makes it a great framework if you develop multiple types of apps
                and want a single framework for automatically testing them all. WebdriverIO uses Puppeteer out-of-the-box. It also comes with integration to Mocha, Jasmine and Cucumber and the whole setup requires just a couple of npm commands. In sum:
                use WebdriverIO if you have extensive and broad testing needs that extend beyond just basic JavaScript tests. </p>
            <p><a class="URL" href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a></p>
            <p class="small_indent">All-in-one testing framework, assertion library, with mocking and stubbing, all without Selenium. Cypress has become one of the most popular JavaScript testing frameworks in recent years, due largely to the fact that it is simple to set up,
                especially if you’re a front-end developer. Cypress also boasts the ability to perform both front-end and (to a certain extent) backend testing. That makes Cypress a good choice for developers who use JavaScript (or Node) for both server-side
                and client-side development. The main limitations of Cypress include limited support for testing mobile apps: it can handle mobile apps that run natively in a browser, but not other types. It also currently only supports three types of
                browsers: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. In sum: if you want a simple yet powerful JavaScript test automation framework that will meet most standard testing needs, Cypress is a great solution. If you need full application and browser coverage,
                however, Cypress on its own falls short.</p>

            <p><a class="URL" href="https://testcafe.io/">TestCafe</a></p>
            <p class="small_indent">TestCafe is similar to Cypress in that it is easy to deploy. It also offers the advantage of supporting both JavaScript and TypeScript as the languages for writing testing scripts. The TypeScript option may be attractive to developers who
                prefer strongly typed languages. TestCafe also supports all of the major desktop browsers, including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Edge, and Safari. It has some limited support for browser-based mobile apps, but in general it is not designed
                for mobile testing. A drawback of TestCafe is that it only supports client-side apps. It’s also designed primarily to be an end-to-end and regression testing framework, and does not work well for unit testing or integration testing. In
                sum: TestCafe is an excellent choice for testing any desktop or mobile JavaScript apps, provided they are client-side only. If you need server-side testing support or mobile testing, look elsewhere.</p>


            <p><a class="URL" href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a></p>
            <p class="small_indent">Released by Microsoft in January 2020, Playwright, which is open source, is one of the newest JavaScript-based test automation frameworks available. In addition to JavaScript, Playwright also supports testing in .NET C#, Java, and Python,
                which makes it handy for developers who need to work with multiple languages. Playwright also supports all of the major modern browsers except Internet Explorer, and it can handle both desktop and mobile testing. As of right now, perhaps
                the biggest drawback of Playwright is that, because the framework is relatively new, it is still evolving, and it doesn’t offer as many integrations as more mature frameworks. The lack of Internet Explorer support is also a limitation,
                as is the fact that Playwright requires a custom browser that must be downloaded each time you want to run a test. This adds time to testing routines, and also means that you can’t test in the actual browser that your users are using.
                Finally, like Puppeteer, Playwright needs to be integrated manually with test frameworks like <a class="URL" href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>, <a class="URL" href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> or <a class="URL" href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>.
                In sum: Playwright is an attractive choice for developer-friendly, cross-browser testing that supports multiple languages, including but not limited to JavaScript. But if you need to test for Internet Explorer, you’ll need a different
                framework. You may also want to wait a bit for Playwright to mature further if you are worried about having to handle rapidly changing APIs.</p>
            <p><a class="URL" href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a></p>
            <p class="small_indent">If you like Playwright but wish it were more stable and mature, you should consider Puppeteer, which has been around in stable form since 2018. Playwright’s lead developers formerly worked on Puppeteer, and the frameworks share much in common:
                they are easy-to-deploy, JavaScript-first browser automation tools that focus on desktop app testing. The main limitation of Puppeteer is that it only fully supports Chrome and Chromium, so it’s not a true cross-browser testing solution.
                That said, the Firefox nightly builds are currently compatible with Puppeteer as well, thanks to collaboration between the Puppeteer team and Mozilla developers. Puppeteer support for stable versions of Firefox is in the works. In sum:
                Puppeteer is the go-to test automation framework for developers who only need to support Chrome and Chromium. For cross-browser tests, frameworks like Playwright provide a similar experience.</p>

        <h3>Agile Environments</h3>

        <h3>Solid understanding of CI/CD Pipelines</h3>
        <p>Continuous Integration/Continous Delivery</p>
        <p>CI - Development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.</p>
        <p>CD - On top of Continuous Integration adds the practice of automating the entire software release process. Continuous Delivery includes infrastructure provisioning and deployment, which may be manual and consist of multiple stages. What’s important
            is that all these processes are fully automated, with each run fully logged and visible to the entire team.</p>
