        <p><b>JavaScrip</b> is a language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as <b>HTML</b>. <b>CSS</b> is the language we use to style <b>HTML</b> documents. <b>CSS</b> is a cornerstone technology of the
            World Wide Web, alongside <b>HTML</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>. It is a simple mechanism for adding style, such as fonts, colors, and spacing to web documents. <b>CSS</b> describes how <b>HTML</b> elements should be displayed. It was developed
            by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C0) with an initial release of December 17, 1996.</p>

        <p><b>CSS</b> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
            enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
            the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

        <p><a class="URL" href="https://webdriver.io/">Webdriverio</a></p>
        <p class="small_indent">Not to be confused with Selenium WebDriver, which supports only browser testing. Next-gen browser and mobile automation test framework for Node.js. WebdriverIO is a progressive automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications.
            It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and stable test suite. WebdriverIO is a test automation framework for both browser and native mobile testing. It’s highly extensible
            and can automate tests for a wide variety of apps running in any mainstream browser or mobile OS. WebdriverIO’s ability to support a broad set of testing needs makes it a great framework if you develop multiple types of apps and want a single
            framework for automatically testing them all. WebdriverIO uses Puppeteer out-of-the-box. It also comes with integration to Mocha, Jasmine and Cucumber and the whole setup requires just a couple of npm commands. In sum: use WebdriverIO if you
            have extensive and broad testing needs that extend beyond just basic JavaScript tests. </p>
        <p><a class="URL" href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a></p>
        <p class="small_indent">All-in-one testing framework, assertion library, with mocking and stubbing, all without Selenium. Cypress has become one of the most popular JavaScript testing frameworks in recent years, due largely to the fact that it is simple to set up, especially
            if you’re a front-end developer. Cypress also boasts the ability to perform both front-end and (to a certain extent) backend testing. That makes Cypress a good choice for developers who use JavaScript (or Node) for both server-side and client-side
            development. The main limitations of Cypress include limited support for testing mobile apps: it can handle mobile apps that run natively in a browser, but not other types. It also currently only supports three types of browsers: Chrome, Edge,
            and Firefox. In sum: if you want a simple yet powerful JavaScript test automation framework that will meet most standard testing needs, Cypress is a great solution. If you need full application and browser coverage, however, Cypress on its
            own falls short.</p>

        <p><a class="URL" href="https://testcafe.io/">TestCafe</a></p>
        <p class="small_indent">TestCafe is similar to Cypress in that it is easy to deploy. It also offers the advantage of supporting both JavaScript and TypeScript as the languages for writing testing scripts. The TypeScript option may be attractive to developers who prefer
            strongly typed languages. TestCafe also supports all of the major desktop browsers, including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Edge, and Safari. It has some limited support for browser-based mobile apps, but in general it is not designed for mobile
            testing. A drawback of TestCafe is that it only supports client-side apps. It’s also designed primarily to be an end-to-end and regression testing framework, and does not work well for unit testing or integration testing. In sum: TestCafe
            is an excellent choice for testing any desktop or mobile JavaScript apps, provided they are client-side only. If you need server-side testing support or mobile testing, look elsewhere.</p>


        <p><a class="URL" href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a></p>
        <p class="small_indent">Released by Microsoft in January 2020, Playwright, which is open source, is one of the newest JavaScript-based test automation frameworks available. In addition to JavaScript, Playwright also supports testing in .NET C#, Java, and Python, which
            makes it handy for developers who need to work with multiple languages. Playwright also supports all of the major modern browsers except Internet Explorer, and it can handle both desktop and mobile testing. As of right now, perhaps the biggest
            drawback of Playwright is that, because the framework is relatively new, it is still evolving, and it doesn’t offer as many integrations as more mature frameworks. The lack of Internet Explorer support is also a limitation, as is the fact
            that Playwright requires a custom browser that must be downloaded each time you want to run a test. This adds time to testing routines, and also means that you can’t test in the actual browser that your users are using. Finally, like Puppeteer,
            Playwright needs to be integrated manually with test frameworks like <a class="URL" href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>, <a class="URL" href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> or <a class="URL" href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. In
            sum: Playwright is an attractive choice for developer-friendly, cross-browser testing that supports multiple languages, including but not limited to JavaScript. But if you need to test for Internet Explorer, you’ll need a different framework.
            You may also want to wait a bit for Playwright to mature further if you are worried about having to handle rapidly changing APIs.</p>
        <p><a class="URL" href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a></p>
        <p class="small_indent">If you like Playwright but wish it were more stable and mature, you should consider Puppeteer, which has been around in stable form since 2018. Playwright’s lead developers formerly worked on Puppeteer, and the frameworks share much in common:
            they are easy-to-deploy, JavaScript-first browser automation tools that focus on desktop app testing. The main limitation of Puppeteer is that it only fully supports Chrome and Chromium, so it’s not a true cross-browser testing solution. That
            said, the Firefox nightly builds are currently compatible with Puppeteer as well, thanks to collaboration between the Puppeteer team and Mozilla developers. Puppeteer support for stable versions of Firefox is in the works. In sum: Puppeteer
            is the go-to test automation framework for developers who only need to support Chrome and Chromium. For cross-browser tests, frameworks like Playwright provide a similar experience.</p>
