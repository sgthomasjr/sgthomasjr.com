        <p>So your many years of IT experiences has cumulated into the area of QA. What are the next steps. Whether a manual program tester or an automation engineer, QA will be a key member of the environment to ensure that products meet or exceed organization/industry
            quality standards and end-user requirements. QA will create test plans and/or write automated tests for assigned components of the software product, execute those test plans, and perform bug tracking and management in a rapid, agile development
            environment utilizing Scum principles. They will collaborate closely with the design team to foster excellent usability and to replicate customer environments while helping to create and implement quality processes and requirements.</p>

        <h3>Things to expect working in QA</h3>
        <p>Generate detailed, comprehensive and well-structured test plans. Devise innovative ways to define and continually improve QA and testing processes. Perform QA testing to ensure tasks are completed as documented; verify that changes are bug free.
            Demonstrate visible progress on work and cross functional behavior to ensure quality, on-time delivery. Engage with Software Engineers and Product Owners to communicate risks and issues and clear impediments that have the potential to impact
            the delivery schedule. Create, contribute to and maintain product documentation, ensuring high level of specification completeness, quality and consistency. Actively engage in the review of documentation and critically assess the existing
            standards and documentation set, fostering continuous improvement. Incorporate approved improvements into the specification and documentation set on an on-going basis and update standards.</p>

        <h3>Gain experience with automated testing frameworks</h3>
        <p>To choose a JavaScript test automation framework, consider several variablesHow many types of apps and configurations do you need to support? Frameworks like WebdriverIO are the most extensible. Do you need to test mobile as well as desktop apps?
            If so, frameworks that broadly support both types of apps, like WebdriverIO, are a good choice. How robust and mature do you want the framework to be? Frameworks like Puppeteer, TestCafe, and WebdriverIO are tried-and-true. Do you need a framework
            that can handle front-end as well as back-end testing, like Cypress? How quick and easy do you want it to be to write, configure, and run tests? Currently, frameworks like Puppeteer and Playwright require some relatively complex configuration,
            especially if you are not using them for the narrow use cases that they support out-of-the-box.</p>

        <h3>Solid understanding of CI/CD Pipelines</h3>
        <p>Continuous Integration/Continous Delivery</p>
        <p>CI - Development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.</p>
        <p>CD - On top of Continuous Integration adds the practice of automating the entire software release process. Continuous Delivery includes infrastructure provisioning and deployment, which may be manual and consist of multiple stages. What’s important
            is that all these processes are fully automated, with each run fully logged and visible to the entire team.</p>
